Objective:
- Some people look at the Github repo heatmap to evaluate how often the owner codes and correlate that with their skill. The code in this repo will help programmers to manipulate the past activities.

- Just for fun, the code here shows the small heart shape in Github heatmap.

Algorithm
- Done with help from ChatGPT.
- The file `auto_commit.py` looks at provided timestamps in the file `working_day.yml`. For each day, it will just add a random text to the file `commit.txt` a random number of times, and `git commit`.
